To get it to run you will need to create an API key: 
https://developers.google.com/webmaster-tools/search-console-api/v1/configure 

Add it to the follow files (there will be empty quotation marks): 
lib/src/data/data.dart line 4
ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift line 11
android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml line 41

Unfortunately the images didnâ€™t have meta data with locations. So I made up some coordinates from all over the world and got data from google places from these coordinates.

I mapped out a lot of function and features with worrying about debugging or optimizing.

Anyway I put about 11 hours into this so this will give you a sense of how I structure a project and prep to demo features.
